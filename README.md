# Practice of DSA as a Beginner 😊 
💻Started a new journey of learning C++ from the basics cause I am also working on various projects in my University so sometimes what happens is I have to focus on that part and give that priorithy so the continuity which DSA needs that consistency I am unable to give it that's why I am starting with Scratch again and I got adviced from my seniors to put your daily basis practice auestions or anything on github, so yeah I am following that advice.
